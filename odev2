question :

Calculate the probability of getting heads or tails when a coin is flipped 1000 times?


from random import randint, choice
tail, head = 0, 0
coin = ["tail", "head"]
for i in range(1000): # we try 1000 times
  a = choice(coin)
  if a == "tail":
    tail += 1
  if a == "head":
    head += 1

print("Possibility of getting tail:", 100 * tail / 1000)
print("probability of getting head:", 100 * head / 1000)


  â€‚
Possibility of getting tail: 53.3
probability of getting head: 46.7
