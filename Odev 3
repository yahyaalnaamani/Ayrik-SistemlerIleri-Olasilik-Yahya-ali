In a pack of 52 cards, a card is drawn at random without replacement. Find the probability of drawing a queen followed by a jack.

Solution:

P (drawing a queen in the first place) = 4 / 52

P (drawing jack in the second place given that queen is in the first place) = 4 / 51

P (drawing a queen followed by a jack)


# Total number of cards in a pack
total_cards = 52

# Number of queens in a pack
queens = 4

# Number of jacks in a pack
jacks = 4

# Probability of drawing a queen followed by a jack
prob_queen_jack = (queens/total_cards) * (jacks/(total_cards-1))

# Displaying the result
print("The probability of drawing a queen followed by a jack from a pack of 52 cards is", round(prob_queen_jack, 4))

The probability of drawing a queen followed by a jack from a pack of 52 cards is 0.006
